data structure
==============

The data structure is a key aspect of the V2G-Sim project. It has been built to be intuitive and flexible.
The object oriented structure allows one to easily study a large number of vehicles, and yet be able to easily access single vehicles.

In this project 'vehicles' is the central object containing a great deal of information on each vehicle. However, vehicles could also be part of a bigger picture as the grid side suggest (plants, and loads).

To resume the UML diagram below, a *vehicle instance* is attached to a *car model* (containing information on the car characteristics but also on the function to compute consumption results).
Every car must have at least one *itinerary* which determine a set of *activities* through the day.
Activities could be of two possible types, *parked* or *driving*, and they both have their own specific variables, however activities also have common parameters such as start date, end date and a power consumption.
Driving activities contain distance traveled as supplementary information, furthermore terrain, GPS coordinates and speed can also be specified if needed.
Parked activity contain a Boolean plugged-in parameter and an assignment to a *location*.
Location have a type ("home", "work", ...) but also GPS coordinates, each location can be linked to a type of *charging infrastructure*.
Charging infrastructure are useful to determine what kind of charger is available, furthermore it also contains the charging algorithm which will be applied.

A V2G-Sim project is basically *a list of vehicles on a map of locations*.
