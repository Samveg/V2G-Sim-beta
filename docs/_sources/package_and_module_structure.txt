packages and modules structure
==============================

The V2G-Sim philosophy is to keep a very flexible architecture. In this project we provide the bare bones so that everything is supported and you can start using the tool right away.
However, one of the goals is to grow the V2G-Sim project based on the implementation of what makes your project unique.

The itinerary and grid package are meant to initiate vehicle's travels and grid state throughout the day.
Currently the itinerary package contains a function to load itineraries from an Excel file. Later on, if input data is coming from a different format such as XML file from MATSIM, the only update will be to add a function in the load module.
You can also find the "itineraryBin" and "create_vehicles" modules(files) in the itinerary package(folder) in order to launch some statistical analysis and create more itineraries. 

Once everything is loaded in the data structure the V2G-Sim magic can operate.

The core module is called to launch a simulation, its role is to call charging and driving function to compute the vehicle's journeys. Thus the module compute the SOC consumption and the grid power demand for a list of vehicles on one of their itinerary. The algorithm is processing every vehicle one by one during a full itinerary.

The charging package is the one that is most likely to be customized by users, as it holds the charging algorithms for plugged vehicles.
A default uncontrolled charging behavior is implemented and can be used as a template to begin developing new charge control strategies.

The driving package holds functions to compute SOC consumption of vehicles while they are driving. While the simple powertrain model is a fast way to compute SOC consumption for a lot of vehicles.
The detailed powertrain enable users to calibrate new simple models, but also to have a look inside the vehicles and collect data useful to quantify degradation.

Finally, the result package provides functions to retrieve results and to visualize them through interactive plots.
