Welcome to V2G-Sim's documentation!
===================================

Abstract
========

The *Vehicle-to-Grid Simulator (V2G-Sim)* provides systematic quantitative methods to address the uncertainties and barriers facing vehicle-grid integration (VGI). 
In the real world, each person drives a different vehicle, in different ways, with different trip distances, at different times. 
Predicting the adequacy of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) for the needs of drivers, and accurately predicting the impacts and opportunities to the electricity grid from increased PEV deployment requires models that can consider these
differences at the individual vehicle level.


V2G-Sim models the driving and charging behavior of individual PEVs to generate temporally- and spatially-resolved predictions of grid impacts and opportunities from increased plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) deployment.
V2G-Sim provides bottom up modeling from individual vehicle dynamics all the way up to aggregate grid impacts and opportunities.
